This project defines and implements the executable specification workflow.

An **executable specification** is a literate program, written in Markdown
with embedded code blocks. Its purpose is to **both describe and verify** the
behavior of a software application, by **combining test suites and documentation**
in the same document.

This repo is a work in progress.
