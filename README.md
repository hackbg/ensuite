This project defines and implements the **literate test suite workflow**,
as used by [Fadroma](https://github.com/hackbg/fadroma).

A **literate test suite** is a program written in Markdown with embedded code blocks.
Its purpose is to **both describe and verify** the behavior of another program
(the **system under test**), by **combining test suites and documentation**
in the same document.

This repo is a work in progress.
